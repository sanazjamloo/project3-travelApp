# Project3-Trelp
Full CRUD action with Angular


# About the Project

Trelp is a web application that allows users to keep track of their trips, and share their comments on each location they have  visited with other users.  

# User Story

### As an anonymous user, I can:
- create a new user account so I can login.
- login so I can add trips I've taken.
- search for a location so I can see others' experiences.

### As a logged in user, I can:
- add places I’ve been so I can keep track of them
- view my trips so I can reminisce.
- edit my locations so I can fix any mistakes I might have made. 
- delete a place I’ve been so I can forget the sad, sad things that happened there…. Or in case I made a mistake.
- sign out at the end of the session so someone else doesn’t mess with my account.



# Necessary Deliverables

- A link to the hosted working app in the Github repo
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
- A link in readme.md to the publicly-accessible user stories you created.

# Approach Taken

1. We started by drawing out our Wireframes using wireframe.cc.
2. We made a planning board using Trello to keep track of the progress of the project.
3. We created models, views, and controllers for the app. Full CRUD was achieved using AngularJS.
4. Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.

# Future Implementations

- Add a rating for each trip and show average ratings for a place when the user search for a place.
- Create more robust search that can filter more than just place names.
- Use Google Maps API to display search results.
- Follow another user.
- Contact another user.
